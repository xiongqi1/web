These are all projects that are using the database driver via rdb_lib.
If the project uses rdb_operations.h, it belongs into this category.

To add a new project, its Makefile must support the install and
clean targets.

The following variables will be set before the project's Makefile
is invoked:

	INSTALLDIR      = The target root directory to install to
	PATH            = Contains a valid toolchain

Dependencies
==============

The Makefile doesn't know what the exact dependencies for the
subprojects are. It guesses that all files in the project's
subdirectory are dependencies. This is used to create the PROJECT.dep
files.

If you feel that this is overkill, e.g. there is no need to rebuild
if there are changes to a README file, copy the PROJECT.dep file
into the project's subdirectory and add it to the project.

The Makefile will use that file in preference to generating a new
one.
