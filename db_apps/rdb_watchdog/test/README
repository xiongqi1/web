How to test RDB watchdog
=========================================================

Copy the rdb_watchdog_test.sh to the router.
Suppose you copy it to /opt/rdb_watchdog_test.sh

There are two test cases available in the script.
The first case is intended to test whether the system reboots when the sys.watchdog.timeToReboot is set to 30.
It also checks whether the reboot request can be cancelled if the sys.watchdog.timeToReboot is set to -1.
Run the following command
$ /opt/rdb_watchdog_test.sh system 5 15
where 5 specifies how often the watchdog is kicked and 15 specifies how soon the watchdog timer expires if it's not kicked.

The second case is intended to test whether the system reboot when the registered variables don't change their value.
$ /opt/rdb_watchdog_test.sh app 5 15

Each test takes a few minutes to complete and shows the result.
If the test is successful, you can see the result message and the system will reboot.
If the system doesn't reboot, it means the actual test fails.
