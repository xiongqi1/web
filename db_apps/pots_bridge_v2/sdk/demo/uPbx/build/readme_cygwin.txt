Due to the new directory structures, for cygwin you need to execute the following command to execute the resulting binary:

export PATH=$PATH:../../platform/cygwin/bin/

or you can change the path variable to have the absolute path, such as:

export PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/Silabs/ProSLIC/proslic_api_7.4.0/proslic_api/demo/platform/cygwin/bin

(for ProSLIC API 7.4.0 default installation).
