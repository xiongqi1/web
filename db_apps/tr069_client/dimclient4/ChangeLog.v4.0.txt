Changes Version 3.0.9:

1. Renamed src/wt104/ directory to src/tr104/ to track formalization of
   the specification document.  Made changes to files and Makefile
   for the change.  Filenames under src/tr104/ did not change.
   [20090109 0000181]

2. Updated copyright dates from 2008 to 2009 as needed.
   [20090302 0000185]

3. Augment existing embedded client to include "STUN client" support 
   to meet TR-111 Part 2 requirements. Interoperate with Dimark ACS 
   with co-located STUN Server system. See src/tr111/TR111_README.txt 
   file for system description and implementation/operation overview.

   GENERAL STUN CHANGE NOTES:
   a) Source files for stun_client are contained under the 
      src/tr111 directory.
   b) "WITH_UDP" compile flag as been deprecated and replaced with 
      "WITH_STUN_CLIENT".
   c) Previous UDP code in src/dimclient.c has been removed and 
      replaced with the new STUN client code. Previous separate thread 
      process "acsUDPHandler()" has been replaced by "stunHandler()".
   d) gSoap is no longer used for UDP Connection Request processing.
   e) OpenSSL HMAC/SHA1 support is now used for UDP Connection Request 
      validation authentication processing. See "man HMAC" and 
      /usr/include/openssl/hmac.h
   f) Utility procedures/features have been added in other code files 
      to accommodate the additional needs of the STUN client. Changes 
      are in thefiles in src/:
        dimclient.c   	     convenientParameter.c
	paramaccess.[ch]     parameter.h

   [20090302 0000186]

4. Added support for reporting TR111 STUN Part 1 Client information
   that is obtained from a compatible/updated Busybox or dhcpcd 
   client via TR111 Part 1 Option 125 information from a TR111 enabled
   DHCP server. See ./README_tr111.txt for more information.
   [20091101 0000227]

5. Add additional logging information to stdout (ongoing).
   Added some extra output showing sendInform count, delayCnt delays,
   and gethostbyname() to show more information about client's 
   reaction to network connectivity issues. 
   [20090302 0000189]

6. In gsoap/stdsoap2.c changed several explicit socket blocking setups 
   to strictly non-blocking.  This also requires specifying soap timeout
   values in src/dimclient.c. and src/filetransfer.c.  Additional code
   added to tcp_disconnect() in gsoap/stdsoap2.c that will appear in the
   gSoap 2.7.14 release.
   [20090713 0000207]

7. Changed storage method of ManagementServer.URL internal from malloc()
   to global fixed in convenientParameter.c
   [20090713 0000208]

8. Changed SOAP_BUFLEN from 8192 to 65536 in gsoap/soapdefs.h to 
   accommodate larger SSL messages for clients with a large number of
   parameters.  Devices with smaller numbers may not need to take up 
   as much reserved memory.  The symptoms of too small a buffer are 
   SSL conversations that just stop.  If the client is compiled with 
   SOAP debugging turned on (DEBUG, SOAP_DEBUG) then the SENT.log file 
   would show a last larger message sent from the client to the server 
   that is truncated. 
   [20090820 0000217 ] replaces/updates [20081123 0000153]
 
9. Previous changes to disable "old netscape cookie" processing in
   gsoap/stdsoap2.c were moved from soap_putsetcookies() to 
   soap_enocde_cookie().  It was found that the previous location
   didn't catch all the cookie processing needed for Motiv ACS
   compliance testing.
   [20091101 0000228]

10. Added setlinebuf() treatment for stdout and stderr in src/dimclient.c
    [20091101 0000229]

11. Added setParameterModified() procedure in src/parameter.c that may
    be called by an external process to indicate to the client that
    a parameter has been "modified externally" and to sample the
    notification flag and to determine Active notification status.
    [20091101 0000230]

12. Added more defines in src/parameter.h for parameter name use
    [20091101 0000231]

13. Added printing out client compilation configuration information
    on startup on stdout.
    [20091101 000232]

14. Added a readme file for SSL Auth certification set up in the client.
    See ./README_sslauth.txt
    [20091101 000233]

15. Added more information for "Parent Not Found" error feedback.
    [20090723 0000209]

16. Fixed "if" clause issue in 3.0.9rc in src/convenientParameters.c
    [20090326 0000202]

Changes Version 3.0.8:

1. Updated src/dimclient.c procedure checkDigestResponse() to remedy an
   infrequent problem with MD5 hashsum values.
   [20080922 0000079]

2. Updated src/dimclient.c myHttpGet() to properly check URL path and
   return 404 error with message for connection request attempts.
   [20081111 0000133]

3. Added copyright.h include file.
   [20081115 0000141]

4. Changed all malloc()'s to calloc()'s to initialize memory to zero.
   [20080922 0000076]

5. Updated gsoap/stdsoap.c soap_http_parse() to handle 401 messages with
   a large amount of body content sometimes produced by MOTIV ACS.
   [20080922 0000077]

6. Changed declaration of cwmp__Upload parameters to correct problem of
   null values being passed to execUpload() in src/dimclient.c. Fixed
   define typo in dimclient.c for listing Upload in supported methods.
   [20081114 0000142]

7. MOTIV ACS does not follow TR-069 by not processing original Netscape
   cookie escape code processing.  Escape creation has been turned off
   with edits in gsoap/stdsoap2.c.
   [20080923 0000074]

8. Fixed typo in src/filetransfer.c for ftp_login() return value
   [20080604 0000015]

9. This release ships with gSoap files included in the distribution, these
   no longer need to be distributed separately.  Files now included in
   distribution are gsoap/* and plugin/*
   [20080922 0000082]

10. Strict type checking relaxation with setParameterValue method call
    value specifications.  Previously ACS and Client must have matching
    xsd:<type> otherwise the client would reject the parameter value.
    Now: if sent type is xsd:string, client target type is evaluated and
    conversion is done (if possible): i.e., string to boolean, string to 
    int, string to unsigned int, string to datetime, etc.  If sent type
    is other than xsd:string, types must match.  This change was done
    to accomodate a valid interpretation of TR-069 value handling.
    [20080929 00000043]

11. Changed soap->recvfd initialization from 0 to -1 in gsoap/stdsoap2.c.
    This prevents soap stdin from attaching to the terminal for bad URL
    specifications.
    [20080927 0000055]	

12. Fixed declaration typo in utils.c.  "ParamterType" to "ParameterType"
    on line 36
    [20080718 0000047]

16. Fix typo in globals.h: "_CHANDE" to "_CHANGE" line 17.
    [20080612 0000034]

17. Increased size of SOAP_BUF length from 2048 to 8192 bytes in file
    gsoap/soapdefs.h to correct message truncation problem under SSL
    [20081123 0000153]

18. Added startup test script for testing as test/start.sh.  Place
    it, dimclient, and dps.param in same directory and run the 
    script. It will initialize /tmp/cpe3/* by creating the needed
    directories (if non-existent) and remove previous data files to
    create a bootstrap run.  The dps.parm file is copied from
    the current test directory to the target /tmp/cpe3 directory.
    Modify the current test directory version before running 
    start.sh again to update the target. Any changes made to
    /tmp/cpe3/dps.param will be overwritten.  Read the script
    to see the actual details.

Changes Version 3.0.7 - Interim release version number.  Ignore.
	
Changes Version 3.0.6m:

1. Modified how memory is malloc()'s and free()'d in dimclient.c procedures to
   free memory on a per message basis rather than on a per Soap session basis.
   This reduces peak memory allocation during conversation with the ACS where
   there may be significant parameters sets and gets over a session.
   New Feature [080715 0000019]
	
2. First version fix of a memory leak issue in plugin/md5evp.c where internal
   data buffer pointed to by ctx->md_data was being lost. Also changed malloc()
   in gsoap/stdsoap2.h to calloc() to create zero-fill memory allocations.
   [080715 0000018]

3. Removed user-defined SOAP_MALLOC define from gsoap/soapdefs.h. Due to the
   way cpp processes, httpda.c was getting the wrong routine when SOAP_DEBUG
   was enabled, creating a memory leak as it's allocated memory was being
   malloc()'s outside of the gSoap debug malloc(), but still be freed by
   the soap debug free() routines that tracked previous memory allocations.
   [080620 0000044]

4. Fixed getparameterNames() tree descent problem.  Now conforms to TR-069
   Amendment 1 example precisely.  [080701 0000039]
	
Changes Version 3.0.6

1. Defaultvalues of Parameters with getIdx > 0 where stored correctly. During creation of a new Object
   the initIdx function is called. Therefor the initIdx must be the same like getIdx or putIdx.

2. Defaultvalues of Parameters stored in memory get lost after a reboot. They are now stored in
   the metafile of the parameter. 

3. DateTimeType handling of REGMan has changed. In former releases it uses integers, now ISO Dates like
   all other ACSs.


Changes Version 3.0.5.x

1. Using InitIdx during Bootstrap phase. InitIdx is now used when a bootstrap ( not normal boot ) happens,
   and a parameter is new created by an addObject call.
   During both calls the initfunction is called with the default value from dps.param.
   It is necessary to enter an init indexnumber in the dps.param for all get-/set- indices with value 1.
   You can use the following awk script to change the initidx number of all entries which have 1 in get- or
   set- index.
--- cut here
BEGIN {
    FS=";"
}
{
    initIdx = $7
    getIdx = $8
    setIdx = $9
    if ( getIdx == 1 || setIdx == 1 )
       initIdx = 1
    printf( "%s;%s;%s;%s;%s;%s;%s;%s;%s;%s;%s\n", $1, $2,$3, $4, $5, $6, initIdx, getIdx, setIdx, $10, $11)
}

--- cut here
   shell>awk -f edit.awk < dps.param > dps.param1
   shell>cp dps.param dps.param1


2. Additional Callbackfunction after loading parameters from storage. If you need information about the
   bootstage, call isBootstrap().


Changes Version 3.0.5

1. The size of the Digest structure fields are extended by 1 byte, to store the EOS byte.

2. Customers has reported, that some embedded C-libs have problems with the atoi and atol functions.
   Therefor these functions are now wrapped in utils.c. The function can there be changed in case
   you have one of these problems.

3. Changes in UPD ConnectionRequest. DoS taken from TCP ConnectionRequest implemented.

4. Types of UploadResponse StartTime and CompleteTime changed to String for supporting UNKNOWN_TIME
   like Download.
    

Changes Version 3.0.4

1. Fileupload is now supported for HTTP protocol. Same procedure like FTP protocol.
   Upload callback support, init in dimclient.c implementation in ftcallback.c.
   Upload callback is called before the upload happens.

2. AddObject and DeleteObject support in hostinterface.
   AddObject is called by add<NL>objectname<NL>  Returns new instanceno
   DeleteObject is called by del<NL>objectname<NL> Returns 0 = ok or errorcode
   ( <NL> is the newline char )

3. AddObject and DeleteObject updates the objectcounter. These counter are located in a parameter
   with the name <parameter>NumberOfEntries, and is located at the same level as the object.
   This feature can be enabled by defining HANDLE_NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES in globals.h

4. An example for accessing the hostinterface can be found in host_if.c.
   It only works with Version 3.0.4 or later.
   The file is not build by the Makefile, for Linux use:  cc -g host_if.c -o host_if

5. Nodelayed Download returns Status 0 instead of 1.
 
6. Function doDownload() in filetransfer.c added parameter fileType, which is the FileType value
   from the SOAP call. This can be used to call your own download procedure depending the FileType.


Changes Version 3.0.3

Bugfixes:

1. In addObject, if storage of a new parameter fails, the parameterdata was not removed from
   the tree in memory. The newly created parameter is removed from it's parent and from memory.
   The service returns with an error code.

2. Fileupload is now supported for FTP protocol. The name of the files to get from the cpe must
   be defined in filetransfer.c array FILENAMES. The mapping from filetype to filename is made
   in type2file(). If you want to used a custom type, you have to made an implementation in this
   function.
   
Changes Version 3.0.2

Bugfixes:

1. Access to a boolean value ( also all other types except string ) leads to a core dump, if
   getIdx = 0 was used.

2. After a call to ChangeParameterAttributes, the NotificationAllways flag was overwriten with the 
   new value. Therefor the value for NotificationAllways was changed from 3 to 4 ( see parameter.h )
   During read of dps.param the value 3 will be patched by 4, but the better way is to change
   dps.param to the new value ( the fourth value in the parameter line )

Changes Version 3.0.x

Bugfixes:

1. In eventhandling different defined names were used for read and write.
   The defines are resolved to the same physical filename.

2. The returned structure in GetParameterAttributes is renamed from GetParameterAttributesStruct 
   to ParameterAttributeStruct, requires changes in dimark.[hc] and parameter.[hc]

3. Cookies are handled now correctly. If the ACS sent more than one Cookie, only the first one
   was returned by the CPE. Fixed now.

4. The CPE does no longer close the connection to the ACS during basic or digest challange phase.

5. In a ConnectionRequest the CPE sent a BASIC and DIGEST response. Fixed now.

6. The ConnectionRequests from ACS are now protected againt DoS attacks. 
   Two defines MAX_REQUESTS_PER_TIME and MAX_REQUEST_TIME are used to allow only a number of 
   connectionRequests during a specified period of time. Otherwise a 505 is returned.

7. The parameter PeriodicIntervalTime is now used if set. See WT121 for description of using this
   parameter.

8. The files and directory were not closed properly in parameterStore.c. Fixed now.

9. There was a problem in setSdCurrentId() if the ACS sent no id. The stringcopy is now save.

10. The nounce value for Digest challange is newly created for every session.

11. The write() in updateParameter() had wrong parameters. the variable buf was used instead of fd.
     
12. For ConnectionRequest the CPE is using Digest Authentification and sends now qop="auth" and
    uses cnonce, qop and ncount for calculation the response.
